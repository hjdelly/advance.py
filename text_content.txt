So I wanna be able to read this content in using Python and then 
I also wanna perform a task. I want to be able to count how many words are 
inside of this file. So that can be something that is very helpful whenever 
you're working with text content is being able to run analytics on it to see 
how many words or how many elements are inside of the file. So that's gonna be 
something you'll probably need to do quite a bit, so we're gonna walk through 
how we can do that here.
